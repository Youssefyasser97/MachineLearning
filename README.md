Machine Learning Assignments using different techniques

Three different projects, each using one or two ML techniques.
First one using Least Squares classification. Second one is divided into two parts, first part uses Perceptron classification, and the second part uses Naive Bayes classification. Finally, the third project uses K-Means classification. They all use a dataset of images containing a drawn numbers, models try to predict the numbers in these pictures and each is given a training and a testing dataset.
